== README

This is a very simple webmail system. I mainly wrote to learn Ruby on Rails.
But nowadays I use it to practice test automation (in separate repository).

=== Requirements
* Ruby 2.3

=== Running the test suite
While in the main directory, run
``rake``

=== Deployment instructions

On a Linux system, copy all files in a local directory. 
Then run:
``./_run``
